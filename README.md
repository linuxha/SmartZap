# SmartZap

This is a Python version of my 1988 GFX BASIC code for the Atari ST and the SmartZap EPROM Burner. I purchased this as a kit from the back of the Computer Shopper. It came with all the parts except the power supply (9-12vAC, I think). It had good documentation (which I need to find), source to a few GW BASIC source code and the source to the firmware. I won't publish the firmware source, I don't have permission.

# History

So it's 1987, I'm in need of a decent and reasonable EPROM burner that can handle all the latest EPROMs and EEPROMs. The 27C256 (32K x 8 bit) was very popular. But 27C64 (8K x 8) was the norm. So one day while reading the Computer Shopper I came across this ad for an EPROM burner kit for less than $100. An excellent price and it even said they'd give you the source code (this was before Open Source, so this was huge). The documentation described putting it together, it was a complete kit (except for a common 12V AC power supply), it used common parts, I'd have the schematic, the API, sample programs to talk to the burner and the source code to the burner if I ever needed to modify it (so far I haven't had to).

An interesting thing about the Computer Shopper. You usually didn't buy it for the articles. Although there were good articles, they only made up a small part of the magazine. You bought it for the ads, and I mainly bought it for the used and surplus compluters and electronics tools and parts section. It was size of a normal newspaper and about 2 inches thick during the best of times. I purchased my first soldering iron (a Weller, I still have it), this EPROM burner, tons of Atari software and hardware like disk drives and I even used the BBS section to get local boards. This is how I got my start in electronics and computers. This was at a time when businesses were transitioning from minis to beige box, PCs that ran MS DOS. So a lot of them were dumping their old stuff. You could get a RGB monitor (slightly better than an old color TV) for half the price of a cheap green composite monitor. Those were interesting times.
